### PERN Stack (Postgress, Express, React, Node)

#### Problem Statement : 
1. Create 50 records in database with the following column fields “sno, customer name, age, phone, location, created_at” and dummy data
2. Create a single page application to display the above data in table format with search option, and pagination with 20 records per page.
